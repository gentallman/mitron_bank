### Problem Statement
Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad, aims to introduce a new line of credit cards to expand its product offerings and market reach. 

AtliQ Data Services, aware of this opportunity through an internal link, proposed implementing this project. However, the strategy director at Mitron Bank, requested a pilot project using sample data before committing to the full project. 

The provided dataset includes information on 4000 customers across five cities, focusing on their online spending behavior.

### Objective
As a data analyst at AtliQ Data Services, we have taken over this project. Our role involves analyzing the sample data and reporting key findings to Mitron Bankâ€™s strategy team. 

The analysis aims to guide the customization of credit cards based on customer needs and market trends. 

The successful acquisition of the project depends on our ability to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations that impress the strategy director and his team
